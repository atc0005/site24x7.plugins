Plugin for ActiveMQ Monitoring 
==============================================

Apache ActiveMQ enables easy processing of messages from various applications and communicates them across your infrastructure. Install and configure the ActiveMQ plugin to get a detailed view of how your systems and services are performing, all in a single, intuitive dashboard.

Follow the below steps to configure the ActiveMQ plugin and the monitoring metrics for providing in-depth visibility into the performance, availability, and usage stats of Apache ActiveMQ instances.

### Prerequisites

- Download and install the latest version of the [Site24x7 Linux agent] / [Site24x7 Windows agent] (https://www.site24x7.com/app/client#/admin/inventory/add-monitor) in the server where you plan to run the plugin. 

- Plugin Uses "JPype" python library. This module is used to execute the jmx query and get data. Execute the below command to install python JPype modeule in your server. 

- Python version must be 3.7 or above.  

		pip install JPype1
		
- JMX connection should be enabled in the Apache ActiveMQ installation folder. To enable the JMX connection follow the below steps: Open conf/activemq.xml inside the installation folder of Apache ActiveMQ and change the following attributes

		<managementContext>
    		     <managementContext createConnector="true" connectorPort="1099"/>
		</managementContext>

Please restart the ActiveMQ instance after making the above changes.

### Plugin installation
---
##### Linux 

- Create a folder "activemq" under Site24x7 Linux Agent plugin directory : 

      Linux            ->   /opt/site24x7/monagent/plugins/activemq

##### Windows 

- Create a folder "activemq" under Site24x7 Windows Agent plugin directory : 

      Windows          ->   C:\Program Files (x86)\Site24x7\WinAgent\monitoring\Plugins\activemq
      
---

- Download all the files in "activemq" folder and place it under the "activemq" directory

	  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/activemq/activemq.py
	  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/activemq/activemq.cfg
	
- Configure the keys to be monitored, as mentioned in the configuration section below.

- Execute the below command with appropriate arguments to check for the valid json output.  

		python activemq.py –-host_name=localhost -–port=1099 -–broker_name=<your_broker_name> --destination_name=<your_queue_name>


The agent will automatically execute the plugin within five minutes and send performance data to the Site24x7 data center.

### Configurations
---
	[display_name]
	host_name=“<your_host_name>”
	port=“1099”
	broker_name=“<your_broker_name>”
	destination_name=“<your_destination_name>”
